# Kruskals-Minimum-Spanning-Tree

You have to implement the Kruskalâ€™s minimum spanning tree algorithm for an undirected
weighted graph G = (V, E) as the fourth offline assignment of CSE 208. Please consider the
following requirements:
1) Implement necessary code for graph representation without using standard template
libraries.
2) Make sure the running time of the algorithm is O (E lg V).
3) Use file operations for input and output.
